    /* ----Collection Framework-------
        - to solve problem with the Arrays
        - DSA - Data Structure Algorithm
        - focus on Business Logic rather than Low level logic

        -----Legacy Class-----//old class
           - Vector
           - Stack
           - Properties
           - Hash Table
           - Dictionary

        ----Collection Framework-------
        - Collection is an Interface -> List, Set, Queue
        - how we want to store the value (update, store, increase, delete)

        1. List - list of students (continous manner with duplicates)
        2. Set - remove the duplicate
        3. Queue - FIFO, LIFO
        - available in java.util.Collection package

        Important in Collection for AUtomation--
        - ArrayList
        - HashSet
        - HashMap

   //Why we have Interface as a Parent of Class
    --> Interface has incomplete methods so the class will complete it
